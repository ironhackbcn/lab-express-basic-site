          <p>Ever since Greta Montenegro was a puppy, she was naturally drawn to the tech industry. That, coupled with her natural cuteness as well as profound empathy for other being, resulted in her working her way up to the position of Happiness Manager at one of the world's most prestigious tech schools, Ironhack.</p>
