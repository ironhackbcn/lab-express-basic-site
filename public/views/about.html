      <h3>This is what we know about them so far ...</h3>
    <p id="main-p">Cats, also called domestic cats (Felis catus), are small, carnivorous (meat-eating) mammals, of the family Felidae. Domestic cats are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets.
      Cats have been domesticated (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years.[2] They are one of the most popular pets in the world. Their origin is probably the African Wildcat Felis silvestris lybica.
      Cats were probably first kept because they ate mice, and this is still their main 'job' in farms throughout the world. Later they were kept because they are friendly and good companions.
      A young cat is called a kitten. Cats are sometimes called kitty. A female cat that has not had its sex organs removed is called a queen. A male cat that has not had its sex organs removed is called a tom.
      Domestic cats are found in shorthair, longhair, and hairless breeds. Cats which are not specific breeds can be referred to as 'domestic shorthair' (DSH) or 'domestic longhair' (DLH).
      The word 'cat' is also used for other felines. Felines are usually called either big cats or small cats. The big, wild cats are well known: lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, pumas, and cheetahs. 
      There are small, wild cats in most parts of the world, such as the lynxin northern Europe. The big cats and wild cats are not tame, and can be very dangerous.
